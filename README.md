Air Quality Detection and Prediction Project
Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive data science project focused on detecting and predicting air quality. The primary goal is to demonstrate a robust and reproducible machine learning workflow, with a strong emphasis on data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.

The project is structured as a step-by-step guide, making it an excellent resource for anyone looking to understand and implement a real-world data science pipeline. The final output is a cleaned, feature-engineered dataset ready for building a predictive model for the Air Quality Index (AQI).

üìä Dataset
The dataset used in this project is city_day.csv, a publicly available dataset from the Kaggle Air Quality in India competition. It includes daily measurements for various cities, with key attributes such as:

City

Date

Concentrations of major pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3)

The final AQI score

üõ†Ô∏è Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
The AirQualityDetection.ipynb notebook meticulously documents all the data processing steps. Key methodologies applied include:

Data Cleaning: Standardizing column names, handling duplicates, and removing irrelevant rows.

Missing Value Imputation: Implementing a hierarchical imputation strategy that fills missing values based on city-specific and temporal medians.

Feature Engineering: Creating new, relevant features from existing data, such as:

Temporal Features: Extracting year, month, and day_of_week from the date.

Trend Features: Calculating 3-day and 7-day rolling means for key pollutants to capture trends.

üìà Data Visualizations
The notebook includes visualizations that provide deeper insights into the data, such as:

A heatmap to show the distribution of missing values before imputation.

Line plots to visualize AQI trends over time for different cities.

A correlation matrix to identify relationships between different pollutants
