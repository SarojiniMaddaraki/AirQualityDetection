# AirQualityDetection
This repository hosts a data science project for Air Quality Detection and Prediction. The core of this project involves comprehensive data preprocessing, including cleaning, handling missing values, and engineering new features.The goal is to prepare a robust dataset for subsequent machine learning models to forecast the Air Quality Index (AQI).
